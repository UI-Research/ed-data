# IPEDS 12 month FTE enrollment: a derived variable
# Available in the data download center and Delta cost project but NOT in the raw data downloads
# Get available years from Delta, latest from IPEDS data download center

# Use Delta where available because IPEDS data downloader gets data for schools in a given year: so if
# you download using "2015 insitutions" and variables for all years you won't get data for schools that
# closed before 2015

# Definition from Delta dictionary:
# The 12-month full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollments are derived from the 12-month instructional activity 
# portion of the Enrollment component (data for this variable are only available for 2004+). FTE enrollment 
# is the sum of the institutionsâ€™ FTE undergraduate and graduate enrollment, plus the estimated FTE of first-professional 
# students. Undergraduate and graduate FTE are calculated using the  12-month instructional activity reported for 
# credit and/or contact hours, with calculation factors . First-professional FTE is estimated by calculating the ratio
# of full-time to part-time first-professional students from the fall enrollment counts and applying this ratio to the 
# 12-month unduplicated headcount of first-professional students. The estimated number of full-time first professional 
# students is added to one-third of the estimated number of part-time first professional students.
